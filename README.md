# certificate-mail
Hey, this is Snith and I created this repository for future personal use. <br>
In this repository, I'll just show how to mail certficates to participants after an event. <br>
Here, I'm using a template for tensorz and aksharakoottam mbcet. <br>
Feel free to edit the html to match the event of your choosing. <br>
<br><br>
First off, download the 'mail-folder' folder. <br>
In that folder, there are three files and one folder in it. <br>
1. Attachments: In this folder, this is where you store the certificates you generated. Generating certificates is a whole different hassle, I won't be talking about that here.
2. list.csv: In this csv file, you will add the name of the participants. Other info is mentioned in the file, read through it.
3. mail.ipynb: this is the python file which handles the mail process. All you gotta do is change the sender's mail and password. Rest are good to go, but you are free to make some aesthetic changes.
4. sample.html: this is the body of your mail. feel free to make changes based on your event and its details.
<br><br>
Once you made your changes, run the ipynb file and you're good to go. Keep in mind, sometimes, only 20 mails can be sent at once.
